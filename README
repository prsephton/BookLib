This project is intended to be really simple.  It uses the idea of a book library to
demonstrate some core concepts behind the grok web framework.

The code for this project accompanies a document called "grok-maintenance.pdf", which
is intended to provide enough information to people who need to maintain a grok project.

Installation:

    pip install grokproject
    grokproject mygrok
    extract this project into mygrok/src/mygrok/
        cd mygrok/src/mygrok/
        git clone https://github.com/prsephton/BookLib.git
    edit mygrok/setup.py and change the entry_points section to contain
          'fanstatic.libraries': [
              'mygrok            = mygrok.resource:library',
              'mygrok.booklib    = mygrok.booklib.resource:library',
          ]
    cd ~/mygrok
    bin/buildout
    bin/paster serve --reload parts/etc/deploy.ini  # Starts the server
